## ⚙️ Technology Stack

This application is powered by a robust, modern set of technologies, chosen for their efficiency and developer experience:

| Technology       | Role                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Expo**         | The open-source platform for building truly universal native apps (iOS, Android, Web) using React Native, including **Expo Router** for file-based routing and streamlined deployment via EAS.                            |
| **React Native** | The foundational framework for building native-like user interfaces using a component-based approach, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and deep access to native APIs.                                               |
| **Appwrite**     | The self-hosted, open-source **Backend-as-a-Service** platform. It handles secure authentication, scalable databases, real-time messaging, and serverless functions, all vital for the movie ranking and data management. |
| **TypeScript**   | A statically-typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality, minimizes runtime errors through type safety, and is essential for building large, maintainable projects.                                           |
| **Tailwind CSS** | A utility-first CSS framework. Used in conjunction with NativeWind to enable rapid, low-level styling for a highly responsive and custom mobile UI.                                                                       |
| **NativeWind**   | The bridge that brings the power and speed of Tailwind CSS utility classes directly to React Native and Expo components.                                                                                                  |
